# pyPSI

pyPSI is a Python library for PSInSAR. The code was (almost) exclusively developed by various Large Language Models, mostly Claude Sonnet 3.5.

pyPSI is an example for implementing a complex remote sensing approach using generative AI. The results have been submitted as "Claude Does PSInSAR: A Tutorial For The Use Of Large-Language
Models In Replication Studies" to the IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Magazine.

The code is licensed under an MIT license and can be used freely. However, users should be aware that most of the code was developed by Large Language Models and that therefore thare might be parts of the code being under copyright. There are possible license and copyright issues with that and users of the code should be aware.
