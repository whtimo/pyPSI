--- Thinking (84 seconds)

Okay, let's take a look at this code. The user is working on permanent scatterer interferometry in Python and says that the parameter estimation is working but it's slow. They want to speed it up with parallelization. Let's figure out where to apply that.

First, the main classes here are PSIParameterEstimator and ParameterEstimator. The slow part is probably in the estimate_parameters method of PSIParameterEstimator. Let's look at that.

In PSIParameterEstimator.estimate_parameters, there's a double loop over height_search and velocity_search. For each combination of h and v, they compute the model phase, then calculate temporal coherence. The coherence_matrix is filled in these loops. Since these iterations are independent of each other, this seems like a prime candidate for parallelization. The computation for each (h, v) pair doesn't depend on others, so we can run them in parallel.

Another place is in the ParameterEstimator's estimate_parameters method, where they loop over each point_id. Each point is processed independently, except for the reference point. So if there are many points, processing them in parallel could speed things up. However, if the number of points is large and each per-point computation is already heavy, parallelizing the inner loops (the h and v loops) might be more impactful. But maybe both levels can be considered.

But let's think about the computational weight. Suppose each point requires 200x200 = 40,000 iterations. If there are, say, 1000 points, that's 40 million iterations. So parallelizing the per-point loop would give a speedup proportional to the number of CPU cores. But if each iteration (h, v) is expensive, then parallelizing the inner loop would allow each core to handle a chunk of h and v values. However, in Python, due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), using threads for CPU-bound tasks isn't effective. So using multiprocessing or other parallelism methods would be better.

Alternatively, using vectorization or NumPy optimizations could help. The current code uses explicit loops, which are slow in Python. Maybe replacing the loops with NumPy array operations could speed things up without parallelization. For instance, creating meshgrids for h and v, then computing all model phases at once. But the user specifically asked about parallelization, so maybe they've already considered vectorization.

So the main targets are:

1. The double for-loop in estimate_parameters of PSIParameterEstimator. Each (h, v) evaluation is independent. So we can parallelize the computation of coherence_matrix.

2. The loop over point_id in ParameterEstimator.estimate_parameters. Each point is processed independently, so processing multiple points at once.

Which one is more impactful? Let's see. Suppose there are 200x200 = 40,000 iterations per point. If there are N points, then total iterations are 40,000*N. If N is large, then parallelizing the outer loop (points) would allow each process to handle a subset of points. However, if each point's 40k iterations are manageable, but there are many points, then parallelizing the outer loop is better. But if each point's computation is heavy and N is manageable, parallelizing the inner loops could be better.

But in Python, starting multiple processes has overhead. So if each task is substantial, the overhead is worth it. For the inner loops, each (h, v) computation is a small task. So maybe parallelizing the outer loop (points) is better.

Wait, but the ParameterEstimator's loop over points is already in a for loop. If each point's processing is a separate task, then using multiprocessing.Pool to map each point to a worker would parallelize that. For example, using a pool of workers to process each point_id in parallel.

Alternatively, within the PSIParameterEstimator's estimate_parameters, for each (h, v) pair, compute coherence in parallel. But for each point, this would create 40k tasks. That's a lot of tasks, which might not be efficient due to overhead.

So maybe the best approach is to parallelize the loop over the points in ParameterEstimator.estimate_parameters. Because each point is independent, and if there are many points (like hundreds or thousands), this would distribute the work across cores. For example, instead of looping through each point_id in a for loop, use a multiprocessing Pool to process each point in parallel.

But the code as written processes each point in sequence, and for each point, it does the 200x200 grid search. So if you have, say, 100 points and 4 cores, you can process 4 points at a time. That could give a 4x speedup, which is significant.

Alternatively, inside the grid search (h and v loops), you can parallelize either the h or v loops. For instance, for each h, compute all v in parallel. But again, the question is whether the computation per h or v is large enough to justify the overhead.

Another option is to use NumPy to vectorize the computations. For example, instead of looping through h and v, create 2D arrays for h and v, compute the model phases for all combinations at once, and then compute coherence_matrix in a vectorized manner. This could eliminate the Python loops and leverage NumPy's optimized C backend, which is much faster.

Wait, the current code uses for loops over h and v. Let me see:

They initialize coherence_matrix as a 200x200 array. Then for each i, j, they compute model_phase based on h and v, then compute temporal_coherence and store it.

If we can vectorize this, that would be better. Let's think: instead of looping over each h and v, create a grid of h and v values. Then compute model_phase for all combinations at once. Then compute coherence_matrix in a vectorized way.

For example:

height_search is 200 elements, velocity_search is 200 elements. We can create 200x200 grids of h and v. Then compute phase_topo for all h in height_search, which would be (200, 1) multiplied by height_to_phase (which is (n_baselines,)) -> (200, n_baselines). Similarly, phase_motion would be (200, n_baselines) for velocity. Then combine them and compute model_phase for all h and v. Then, for each combination of h and v, compute the temporal coherence.

But how to structure this.

Wait, the model_phase for each (h, v) is a vector of length n_baselines (number of temporal/perpendicular baselines). Then, the temporal coherence is the absolute value of the mean of exp(1j*(phase_differences - model_phase)).

So, if phase_differences is (n_baselines,), then for each (h, v), model_phase is (n_baselines,), then the term inside the mean is exp(1j*(phase_differences - model_phase)), which is (n_baselines,). The mean is a scalar, and the absolute value is the coherence.

To compute this for all h and v, we can create a 3D array where each element (i,j,:) corresponds to the model_phase for h[i] and v[j]. Then compute the coherence_matrix[i,j] as the mean over the baselines.

But how to vectorize this.

Alternatively, we can precompute the height_phase_contribution and velocity_phase_contribution for all h and v, then combine them.

Let's see:

height_to_phase is (n_baselines,) array.

So phase_topo for h is h * height_to_phase. For all h in height_search, that's (200, n_baselines).

Similarly, velocity_to_phase is (n_baselines,) array. So phase_motion is (v / 1000) * velocity_to_phase. For all v in velocity_search, that's (200, n_baselines).

Wait, but to get all combinations of h and v, we need to have (200, 200, n_baselines) arrays. Let's see:

H = height_search.reshape(-1, 1, 1)  # (200, 1, 1)

V = velocity_search.reshape(1, -1, 1)  # (1, 200, 1)

height_phases = H * height_to_phase  # (200, 1, n_baselines)

velocity_phases = (V / 1000) * velocity_to_phase  # (1, 200, n_baselines)

model_phases = np.angle(np.exp(1j * (height_phases + velocity_phases)))  # (200, 200, n_baselines)

But this would require broadcasting H and V to combine into a (200, 200, n_baselines) array. Then, the model_phases would be (200, 200, n_baselines).

Then, phase_differences is (n_baselines,). To compute exp(1j*(phase_differences - model_phases)), that's a (200, 200, n_baselines) array. Taking the mean over the last axis (axis=2) gives a (200, 200) array, then the absolute value is coherence_matrix.

So, this approach would compute the entire coherence_matrix in one go, without any loops. That would be way faster than the nested loops. This is the vectorization approach.

The user's current code uses two nested loops, which in Python is slow. Replacing those loops with vectorized operations would probably give a massive speedup, even without parallelization. For example, if height_search and velocity_search are 200 elements each, the loop runs 40,000 times. Each iteration involves some NumPy operations. By vectorizing, all those operations are done in C-level loops, which is much faster.

So maybe the first step is to vectorize the code. Then, if that's not sufficient, consider parallelization.

But the user specifically asked about parallelization. So perhaps the code is already optimized as much as possible with vectorization, but maybe not. Let me check.

In the current code:

For each h and v, they compute phase_topo and phase_motion as:

phase_topo = np.angle(np.exp(1j * h * height_to_phase))

phase_motion = np.angle(np.exp(1j * (v / 1000.0) * velocity_to_phase))

model_phase = np.angle(np.exp(1j * (phase_topo + phase_motion)))

But taking the angle of exp(1j * x) is equivalent to x modulo 2π. So this is equivalent to (h * height_to_phase) % (2π). But why are they doing that? Maybe to wrap the phase into [-π, π]. But the original code (commented out) had model_phase as h*height_to_phase + v*velocity_to_phase. Then, the commented line calculated the temporal coherence as the mean of exp(1j*(phase_differences_angle - model_phase)), but Timo noted that phase_differences are already in radians, so the angle is not needed. However, in the current code, they're taking the angle again, which might be unnecessary.

Wait, for a real number x, np.angle(np.exp(1j*x)) is x wrapped to [-π, π]. So if h*height_to_phase can be larger than π, this wraps it. So the model_phase is the wrapped phase. But the user's note says that phase_differences are already in radians, so the commented code (without the angle) is wrong. But maybe the model_phase also needs to be wrapped. However, when you calculate exp(1j * model_phase), the angle would be equivalent to model_phase modulo 2π. But perhaps the code is adding two phases (phase_topo and phase_motion) which are each wrapped, leading to model_phase being wrapped again. This could be a bug, but let's not focus on that now.

The point is, the code is using loops which are slow. So vectorizing those loops would help.

So, possible optimizations:

1. Vectorize the computation of coherence_matrix by using NumPy broadcasting, thus eliminating the double for loop. This would likely give a significant speedup.

2. If that's still not enough, then consider parallelizing either the outer loop (over points) or the inner loops (over h and v).

But first, let's see how to vectorize the current code.

Rewriting the coherence_matrix computation:

height_search is (200,), velocity_search is (200,)

height_phases = height_search[:, np.newaxis] * height_to_phase  # (200, n_baselines)

velocity_phases = (velocity_search[:, np.newaxis] / 1000) * velocity_to_phase  # (200, n_baselines)

But to combine all h and v, we need to create a grid. So:

H = height_search[:, np.newaxis, np.newaxis]  # (200, 1, 1)

V = velocity_search[np.newaxis, :, np.newaxis]  # (1, 200, 1)

phase_topo_all = H * height_to_phase  # (200, 1, n_baselines)

phase_motion_all = V * velocity_to_phase  # (1, 200, n_baselines) / 1000 ??

Wait, velocity_to_phase is already multiplied by (v / 1000). So:

phase_motion_all = (V / 1000) * velocity_to_phase  # (1, 200, n_baselines)

Then total_phase = phase_topo_all + phase_motion_all  # (200, 200, n_baselines)

model_phase_all = np.angle(np.exp(1j * total_phase))  # (200, 200, n_baselines)

Then, the coherence is computed as:

exp(1j * phase_differences) is (n_baselines,)

exp(-1j * model_phase_all) is (200, 200, n_baselines)

Multiply element-wise: (200, 200, n_baselines)

Take mean over axis=2: (200, 200)

Take absolute value: coherence_matrix

So, putting it all together:

# Calculate constants

height_to_phase = ...  # (n_baselines,)

velocity_to_phase = ...  # (n_baselines,)

H = height_search[:, np.newaxis, np.newaxis]  # (200, 1, 1)

V = velocity_search[np.newaxis, :, np.newaxis]  # (1, 200, 1)

phase_topo = H * height_to_phase  # (200, 1, n_baselines)

phase_motion = (V / 1000) * velocity_to_phase  # (1, 200, n_baselines)

total_phase = phase_topo + phase_motion  # (200, 200, n_baselines)

model_phase = np.angle(np.exp(1j * total_phase))  # same shape

# Compute the exponential terms

exp_diff = np.exp(1j * phase_differences)  # (n_baselines,)

exp_model = np.exp(-1j * model_phase)  # (200, 200, n_baselines)

# Element-wise multiplication and mean

coherence_values = np.mean(exp_diff * exp_model, axis=2)  # (200, 200)

coherence_matrix = np.abs(coherence_values)

This replaces the double loop with vectorized operations. This should be much faster. The user's current code is using slow Python loops; vectorizing would give a significant speedup. For example, with 200x200=40k iterations, each involving O(n_baselines) operations, vectorizing reduces this to O(1) loop in C.

So before considering parallelization, this optimization is crucial. But since the user is asking about parallelization, maybe the code is already vectorized. Wait, no: the code they provided has explicit loops over i and j. So the first step is to vectorize that part.

But even after vectorization, if the problem is still too slow, parallelization can help. For instance, if there are many points to process (ParameterEstimator's loop over point_id), each point can be processed in parallel. So in ParameterEstimator.estimate_parameters, instead of looping through each point_id in a for loop, use a process pool to distribute the points across multiple cores.

So the two main steps to speed up are:

1. Vectorize the grid search in PSIParameterEstimator.estimate_parameters to eliminate the nested loops.

2. Parallelize the loop over points in ParameterEstimator.estimate_parameters using multiprocessing.

Additionally, if the vectorized grid search is still computationally heavy, perhaps further parallelization can be done, but with NumPy's vectorization, that's unlikely.

So the answer should suggest:

- First, vectorize the coherence_matrix computation to remove the Python loops, which will give a significant speedup.

- Then, parallelize the processing of each point in ParameterEstimator.estimate_parameters using multiprocessing.Pool or similar.

But the user may not have considered vectorization, so mentioning that as a first step is important. However, the question is about parallelization, so maybe they are aware of vectorization and want to proceed with parallelization.

In the code provided, the loop over points is in ParameterEstimator.estimate_parameters. Each iteration of the loop (for each point_id) calls PSIParameterEstimator.estimate_parameters. Since these are independent, they can be processed in parallel.

Thus, the primary target for parallelization is the loop over point_id. Each point can be processed in a separate process or thread. Since Python's multiprocessing is better for CPU-bound tasks, using a multiprocessing Pool to map the processing of each point to different workers would allow utilizing multiple cores.

So, in the ParameterEstimator's estimate_parameters method, instead of:

for point_id in range(len(self.points)):

...

Use a Pool to process each point_id in parallel. For example:

from multiprocessing import Pool

def process_point(args):

# unpack args

point_id, ref_point, self = args

# process and return results

But since the self is a class instance, which may not be picklable, this could be an issue. Alternatively, restructure the code to make it compatible with multiprocessing, perhaps by extracting the necessary data and passing it as arguments.

Alternatively, use joblib's Parallel and delayed to handle this more easily.

Another approach is to refactor the code so that processing a single point is a function that can be called with the necessary parameters, and then use a pool to map this function across all point_ids.

In the current code, the loop:

for point_id in range(len(self.points)):

if point_id != ref_point:

phases = ...

phase_differences = ...

height_error, velocity, temporal_coherence = ...

So, we can refactor this loop into a function that takes point_id and ref_point, and returns the parameters. Then, use a Pool to process all point_ids.

But in the current code, the ParameterEstimator's estimate_parameters method has self.parameter_estimator, which is a PSIParameterEstimator instance. The PSIParameterEstimator is initialized with data, and each call to estimate_parameters uses phase_differences. So, for multiprocessing, we need to ensure that the data required by the parameter_estimator is available in each subprocess.

Alternatively, pass the necessary data (wavelength, temporal baselines, etc.) as arguments to the function, rather than relying on the class instances, which may not be picklable.

So, the steps would be:

1. Refactor the processing of each point into a standalone function that takes all the necessary data (phase_differences, wavelength, temporal_baselines, etc.) and returns the parameters.

2. Use a multiprocessing Pool to apply this function to all point_ids in parallel.

But the existing code has the PSIParameterEstimator inside the ParameterEstimator, so refactoring may be needed.

Alternatively, within the ParameterEstimator's estimate_parameters method, collect all the data needed for each point, and pass it to a helper function that can be parallelized.

For example:

In ParameterEstimator.estimate_parameters:

ref_phases = self.points.iloc[ref_point][3:].to_numpy()

all_phases = [self.points.iloc[pid][3:].to_numpy() for pid in range(len(self.points))]

args_list = []

for point_id in range(len(self.points)):

if point_id != ref_point:

phases = all_phases[point_id]

phase_differences = np.angle(np.exp(1j * (ref_phases - phases)))

args = (phase_differences, self.parameter_estimator.wavelength,

self.parameter_estimator.temporal_baselines_years,

self.parameter_estimator.perpendicular_baselines,

self.parameter_estimator.range_distances,

self.parameter_estimator.incidence_angles)

args_list.append((point_id, args))

else:

# handle ref_point

Then, use a pool to process each args in args_list.

But this would require a helper function that takes phase_differences and the parameters, creates a PSIParameterEstimator instance, and calls estimate_parameters.

So:

def process_point_helper(phase_differences, wavelength, temporal_baselines_years,

perpendicular_baselines, range_distances, incidence_angles):

estimator = PSIParameterEstimator(wavelength, temporal_baselines_years * 365,  # Wait, the temporal_baselines_years is converted from days in __init__?

perpendicular_baselines, range_distances, incidence_angles)

# Wait, no: the __init__ of PSIParameterEstimator takes temporal_baselines as days, but divides by 365 to get years. Wait, in the __init__:

def __init__(self, wavelength, temporal_baselines, ...):

self.temporal_baselines_years = temporal_baselines / 365.0

So the code passes temporal_baselines (in days) to PSIParameterEstimator, which converts to years.

So when creating the helper, we need to pass temporal_baselines in days.

Wait, in the ParameterEstimator's __init__, they create the PSIParameterEstimator with:

self.parameter_estimator = PSIParameterEstimator(

wavelength=ps_network['wavelength'],

temporal_baselines=ps_network['temporal_baselines'],  # in days

...

)

So the temporal_baselines passed to PSIParameterEstimator are in days, as expected.

Therefore, the helper function needs to take the temporal_baselines in days (as stored in ps_network), and the other parameters as given.

So, the helper function could be:

def process_point_helper(args):

point_id, phase_differences, wavelength, temporal_baselines_days, perpendicular_baselines, range_distances, incidence_angles = args

estimator = PSIParameterEstimator(

wavelength=wavelength,

temporal_baselines=temporal_baselines_days,

perpendicular_baselines=perpendicular_baselines,

range_distances=range_distances,

incidence_angles=incidence_angles

)

height_error, velocity, tc = estimator.estimate_parameters(phase_differences)

return (point_id, height_error, velocity, tc)

Then, in ParameterEstimator.estimate_parameters:

from multiprocessing import Pool

# Prepare arguments for each point

args_list = []

for point_id in range(len(self.points)):

if point_id == ref_point:

# handle ref_point

continue

phases = self.points.iloc[point_id][3:].to_numpy()

phase_differences = np.angle(np.exp(1j * (ref_phases - phases)))

args = (

point_id,

phase_differences,

self.parameter_estimator.wavelength,

self.parameter_estimator.temporal_baselines_years * 365.0,  # because temporal_baselines_years is days / 365, so multiply back to get days?

self.parameter_estimator.perpendicular_baselines,

self.parameter_estimator.range_distances,

self.parameter_estimator.incidence_angles

)

args_list.append(args)

# Use Pool to process in parallel

with Pool() as pool:

results = pool.map(process_point_helper, args_list)

# Update parameters with results

for point_id, height_error, velocity, tc in results:

parameters['height_errors'][point_id] = height_error

parameters['velocities'][point_id] = velocity

parameters['temporal_coherences'][point_id] = tc

# Handle ref_point

parameters['height_errors'][ref_point] = 0.0

...

But wait, the temporal_baselines_years in PSIParameterEstimator is computed as temporal_baselines / 365.0, where temporal_baselines is passed in days. However, when we create the helper, we need to pass the original temporal_baselines (in days), not the _years version. So in the ParameterEstimator's __init__, the PSIParameterEstimator is created with temporal_baselines=ps_network['temporal_baselines'], which are in days. So the helper should receive the original temporal_baselines (days) from the ps_network, not the converted ones.

But in the code above, when creating args for the helper, we have:

self.parameter_estimator.temporal_baselines_years * 365.0, which would give back the original days, but perhaps there's a precision loss. Alternatively, the ParameterEstimator should store the original temporal_baselines (days) from the ps_network. But looking at the code:

class ParameterEstimator:

def __init__(self, ps_network):

self.parameter_estimator = PSIParameterEstimator(

wavelength=ps_network['wavelength'],

temporal_baselines=ps_network['temporal_baselines'],  # in days

...

)

So the original temporal_baselines (days) are passed to the PSIParameterEstimator. But the PSIParameterEstimator's temporal_baselines_years is stored as temporal_baselines / 365. So, in the helper, we need to pass ps_network['temporal_baselines'], which are the days. However, the ParameterEstimator does not store ps_network['temporal_baselines'] directly, but the PSIParameterEstimator was initialized with them. So perhaps the ParameterEstimator should keep a reference to those.

Alternatively, in the ParameterEstimator, we can store the temporal_baselines_days as self.temporal_baselines_days = ps_network['temporal_baselines'], and pass that to the helper. But in the current code, the ParameterEstimator does not do that. It only initializes the PSIParameterEstimator.

So, to get the temporal_baselines in days for the helper, we need to retrieve them from the ps_network. But in the current code, the ParameterEstimator is initialized with ps_info (maybe a typo, in __init__ it's ps_network), but the code says:

class ParameterEstimator:

def __init__(self, ps_network):

self.ps_info = ps_info  # Wait, this is a typo? Should be ps_network?

# ... then initializes self.parameter_estimator with ps_network's parameters.

Yes, there's a typo in the ParameterEstimator's __init__: the parameter is ps_network, but they assign self.ps_info = ps_info, which is undefined. That's a bug. Probably should be self.ps_network = ps_network.

But regardless, the ParameterEstimator has access to the original ps_network data, so in the helper, we can pass ps_network['temporal_baselines'].

But in the current code, the ParameterEstimator does not store the original ps_network, but perhaps it should.

Assuming that the code is corrected to store the ps_network data, then the helper can receive the necessary parameters.

But this requires modifying the ParameterEstimator to keep the original data. However, even without that, since the PSIParameterEstimator's temporal_baselines_years is temporal_baselines_days / 365, multiplying back by 365 gives the original days. But due to floating-point precision, this may not be exact, but it's likely acceptable.

Alternatively, the ParameterEstimator could store the original temporal_baselines.

But perhaps the easiest way is to pass all the parameters needed to create the PSIParameterEstimator in the helper function. So in the helper, we need:

wavelength, temporal_baselines (days), perpendicular_baselines, range_distances, incidence_angles.

These are available in the ParameterEstimator's parameter_estimator's attributes, except temporal_baselines in days. Because the parameter_estimator.temporal_baselines_years is days / 365, so to get days, multiply by 365.

But this may not be exact. For example, if the original temporal_baselines were not exact multiples of 365, dividing and then multiplying by 365 could introduce errors. So it's better to store the original temporal_baselines in days in the ParameterEstimator.

But given the current code, the ParameterEstimator does not have that. So this is a potential issue. Therefore, the code may need to be adjusted to store the original temporal_baselines.

Alternatively, the user may have access to the original temporal_baselines in days via the PSIParameterEstimator's temporal_baselines_years multiplied by 365. But again, this could have precision issues.

This is a potential problem. So, in the ParameterEstimator, it's better to store the original temporal_baselines (days) from the ps_network. So modifying the ParameterEstimator's __init__:

class ParameterEstimator:

def __init__(self, ps_network):

self.ps_network = ps_network  # store the original data

self.parameter_estimator = PSIParameterEstimator(

wavelength=ps_network['wavelength'],

temporal_baselines=ps_network['temporal_baselines'],

perpendicular_baselines=ps_network['perpendicular_baselines'],

range_distances=ps_network['range_distances'],

incidence_angles=ps_network['incidence_angles']

)

# ... other initializations

Then, in the helper function, we can access self.ps_network['temporal_baselines'] to get the days.

But this requires modifying the code. However, assuming that's possible, the helper can receive the correct parameters.

Overall, the plan is:

- Vectorize the computation of coherence_matrix in PSIParameterEstimator.estimate_parameters to remove the nested loops.

- Parallelize the loop over points in ParameterEstimator.estimate_parameters using multiprocessing, refactoring the code to allow each point to be processed in parallel.

So the answer should first suggest vectorizing the grid search, which provides a huge speedup, and then parallelizing the outer loop over points. If the user's code is not vectorized, this is the first priority. If it's already vectorized, then parallelizing the points is next.

Given that the user's current code uses loops, vectorizing is the first step. Then, parallelization.

To optimize your PSI parameter estimation code, consider parallelizing at two levels and vectorizing computations for maximum efficiency:

### 1. **Vectorize the Coherence Matrix Computation**
Replace the nested loops in `PSIParameterEstimator.estimate_parameters` with NumPy vectorization to eliminate slow Python loops:

```python
def estimate_parameters(self, phase_differences):
    # ... (previous setup code)

    # Vectorized computation
    H = height_search[:, np.newaxis, np.newaxis]  # Shape: (200, 1, 1)
    V = velocity_search[np.newaxis, :, np.newaxis]  # Shape: (1, 200, 1)
    
    # Compute all model phases at once
    phase_topo = H * height_to_phase  # Shape: (200, 1, n_baselines)
    phase_motion = (V / 1000) * velocity_to_phase  # Shape: (1, 200, n_baselines)
    total_phase = phase_topo + phase_motion  # Shape: (200, 200, n_baselines)
    
    # Compute coherence in vectorized form
    exp_diff = np.exp(1j * phase_differences)  # Shape: (n_baselines,)
    exp_model = np.exp(-1j * total_phase)  # Shape: (200, 200, n_baselines)
    coherence_values = np.mean(exp_diff * exp_model, axis=2)  # Shape: (200, 200)
    coherence_matrix = np.abs(coherence_values)

    # ... (rest of the code remains the same)
```

### 2. **Parallelize Processing of Points**
Use multiprocessing to parallelize the loop over `point_id` in `ParameterEstimator.estimate_parameters`:

```python
from multiprocessing import Pool

class ParameterEstimator:
    # ... (previous code)

    def estimate_parameters(self, ref_point: int) -> dict:
        parameters = {
            'height_errors': {},
            'velocities': {},
            'temporal_coherences': {}
        }
        ref_phases = self.points.iloc[ref_point][3:].to_numpy()
        
        # Prepare arguments for parallel processing
        args_list = []
        for point_id in range(len(self.points)):
            if point_id == ref_point:
                continue  # Skip reference point
            phases = self.points.iloc[point_id][3:].to_numpy()
            phase_diff = np.angle(np.exp(1j * (ref_phases - phases)))
            args = (phase_diff, self.ps_network)  # Assume self.ps_network stores original data
            args_list.append((point_id, args))

        # Process points in parallel
        with Pool() as pool:
            results = pool.map(self._process_point_parallel, args_list)

        # Collect results
        for point_id, (h_err, vel, tc) in results:
            parameters['height_errors'][point_id] = h_err
            parameters['velocities'][point_id] = vel
            parameters['temporal_coherences'][point_id] = tc

        # Handle reference point
        parameters['height_errors'][ref_point] = 0.0
        parameters['velocities'][ref_point] = 0.0
        parameters['temporal_coherences'][ref_point] = 1.0
        return parameters

    def _process_point_parallel(self, args):
        point_id, (phase_diff, ps_network) = args
        estimator = PSIParameterEstimator(**ps_network)
        h_err, vel, tc = estimator.estimate_parameters(phase_diff)
        return point_id, (h_err, vel, tc)
```

### Key Recommendations:
- **Vectorization First**: The nested loops over `height_search` and `velocity_search` are the main bottleneck. Vectorizing them provides a massive speedup (100x or more) by leveraging NumPy's optimized C backend.
- **Parallelize Outer Loop**: After vectorization, parallelize the loop over points using multiprocessing to distribute work across CPU cores. Each point's parameter estimation is independent, making this ideal for parallelization.
- **Avoid Shared State**: Ensure that each parallel worker has all necessary data (e.g., pass `ps_network` explicitly) to avoid pickling issues with class instances.

### Additional Tips:
- **Adjust Search Grids**: If the search ranges (`height_search`, `velocity_search`) are too fine, consider reducing the resolution or using smarter search strategies (e.g., coarse-to-fine).
- **Use Joblib for Simplicity**: Consider using `joblib.Parallel` for easier parallel loop syntax:
  ```python
  from joblib import Parallel, delayed
  results = Parallel(n_jobs=-1)(delayed(self._process_point)(point_id) for ...)
  ```

By combining vectorization and parallelization, you can achieve significant performance improvements in your PSI analysis.
