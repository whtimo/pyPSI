> I have a tiff file containing the number of brotherhood pixels of statistically homogenous pixels as uint16 values. I want to display that in Python3, with a color scale like turbo or something similar. The legend should be there as well. Please only show me the code and do not run it in the code interpreter.

I'll provide you with Python code that reads and displays a TIFF file with a turbo colormap and includes a legend. Here's the code without execution:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.colors import TwoSlopeNorm
import rasterio

# Read the TIFF file
with rasterio.open('your_file.tiff') as src:
    data = src.read(1)  # Read the first band

# Create the figure and axis
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 8))

# Create the image plot with turbo colormap
im = ax.imshow(data, cmap='turbo')

# Add colorbar
cbar = plt.colorbar(im)
cbar.set_label('Pixel Values', rotation=270, labelpad=15)

# Add title
plt.title('Brotherhood Pixels Distribution')

# Adjust layout to prevent cutting off labels
plt.tight_layout()

# Show the plot
plt.show()
```

This code:
1. Uses `rasterio` to read the TIFF file (more robust than PIL for geospatial data)
2. Displays the data using matplotlib's `imshow` with the turbo colormap
3. Adds a colorbar legend with a label
4. Includes a title and proper layout adjustments

Make sure to:
1. Replace 'your_file.tiff' with your actual file path
2. Install rasterio if you haven't (`pip install rasterio`)
3. The turbo colormap is available in newer versions of matplotlib (2.2.0+)

If you need a different colormap, you can replace 'turbo' with others like 'viridis', 'plasma', or 'jet'.
